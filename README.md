# CS498GD-InfiniteMatrix
Project 1 for CS498 Game Development

Hi! Welcome to my CS498 Infinite Matrix Project. This is an Unreal Engine game I built following the base tutorial from: https://www.raywenderlich.com/454-how-to-create-a-simple-game-in-unreal-engine-4

Some features: I added a custom texture to the enemies that I got from a free asset repo: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dwqsl9/ive_made_50_free_rigged_and_animated_lowpoly/

**ALSO NOTE TO THE GRADER PLEASE USE THE InfiniteMatrixStarter 4.27 PROJECT AS MY FINAL SUBMISSION**
